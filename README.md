# Overview
This project implements an Error Boundary component in a Next.js application to gracefully handle JavaScript errors that occur during rendering. The solution includes creating an ErrorBoundary class component, integrating it with the application, testing it with an error-prone component, and adding error monitoring with Sentry.

# Learning Objectives
Understand how React Error Boundaries work
Implement a class component in TypeScript
Handle runtime errors gracefully in a Next.js application
Integrate third-party error monitoring services
Test error handling components effectively
Key Concepts
Error Boundaries: Special React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree
Component Lifecycle Methods: Using getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch to handle errors
Error Monitoring: Integrating services like Sentry for production error tracking
Fallback UI: Providing user-friendly error messages when components fail
Error Recovery: Implementing ‚ÄúTry again‚Äù functionality for users
Tools and Libraries
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript
Next.js: React framework for server-rendered applications
Sentry: Error monitoring and tracking service
Node.js/npm: JavaScript runtime and package manager
Real-World Use Case
Error boundaries are essential in production applications to: 1. Prevent entire application crashes from single component failures 2. Provide meaningful error messages to users instead of blank screens 3. Track and monitor errors in production environments 4. Allow users to recover from non-critical errors 5. Maintain application stability and improve user experience

This implementation pattern is used by major web applications to ensure reliability and maintainability. The Sentry integration provides valuable insights for debugging and fixing issues that occur in production.

# Implementation Summary
Created an ErrorBoundary class component with proper TypeScript interfaces
Wrapped the main application component with the ErrorBoundary
Developed a test component that intentionally throws errors
Integrated Sentry for error monitoring and logging
Implemented a fallback UI with error recovery option
This solution follows React best practices for error handling while demonstrating modern web development techniques with TypeScript and Next.js.
